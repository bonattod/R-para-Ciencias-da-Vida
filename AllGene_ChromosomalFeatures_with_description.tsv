S000130715	not in systematic sequence of S288C	ENA6	Plasma membrane sodium-pumping ATPase; the ENA6 gene is found in the PMR2 locus in the CEN.PK113-7D strain of S. cerevisiae, where other common lab strains have a varying number of the ENA genes (ENA1-ENA5) at the same locus	
S000132612	ncRNA_gene	ICR1	Long intergenic regulatory ncRNA; has a key role in regulating transcription of the nearby protein-coding ORF FLO11; initiated far upstream from FLO11 and transcribed across much of the large promoter of FLO11, repressing FLO11 transcription in cis	
S000132614	ncRNA_gene	PWR1	Intergenic regulatory ncRNA; one of two long ncRNAs that play key roles in regulating transcription of the nearby protein-coding ORF FLO11; PWR1 promotes FLO11 transcription by interfering with ncRNA ICR1, which is transcribed across the FLO11 promoter	
S000133140	not in systematic sequence of S288C	XDH1	Xylitol dehydrogenase; involved in utilization of xylose as a carbon source; not present in S288C, but located in a 65kb insertion on the right arm of chromosome XV in many wine strains such as EC1118 and AWRI1631	
S000134352	not in systematic sequence of S288C	SUC8	Invertase; sucrose hydrolyzing enzyme; seven closely related but non-identical invertase genes have been described in yeast (SUC1-5, 7, 8) but only SUC2 is in the reference strain (S288C)	
S000144908	ncRNA_gene	RME2	Antisense transcript initiated from the 3' end of the IME4 locus; expressed in haploids and interferes with IME4 expression through a cis-acting mechanism; RME2 expression is repressed by the MAT a1/alpha2 repressor complex	IME4-AS
S000144910	ncRNA_gene	RME3	Antisense transcript that represses the meiosis-specific ZIP2 gene; expressed in haploid cells under sporulation inducing conditions; regulates ZIP2 in a cis-dependent manner; RME3 is repressed by the MAT a1/alpha2 complex in diploid cells	SUT534
S000145155	not in systematic sequence of S288C	FPG1	Putative cell wall mannoprotein involved in foam formation; contains a signal peptide and a putative GPI anchor; protein precursor homologous to Awa1p and Hpf1p	
S000149345	not in systematic sequence of S288C	IMI1	Protein involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and glutathione homeostasis; localized to the cytoplasm; in W303 strain IMI1 is encoded by one continuous open reading frame comprising of YDL037C, the intergenic region and YDL039C, while in the reference sequence of S288C, YDL037C encodes Bsc1p and YDL039C encodes Prm7p.	
S000150108	not in systematic sequence of S288C	MPR2	L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid acetyltransferase; reduces intracellular ROS, contributes to L-proline analog resistance and tolerance to ethanol and freezing; member of N-acetyltransferase superfamily; not found in S288C, present in strains with Sigma1278b background; located on left arm of Chr X ~ 15 kb from telomere; identical to MPR1 except for one base at position 254, leading to Gly at position 85 in MPR1 and Glu in MPR2; present also in Japanese industrial baker's yeast
